# How to contribute to Glyco

## User Experience principles

## What can I contribute with
* Adding Issues: you can either add an issue if you notice anything.
* Fixing Issues.
* Features: features are less prioritised than issues and may take a longer time to accept since they add more.

On the list:
* Add a schema to the glucose dataframe, the meals dataframe.
