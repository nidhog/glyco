# Continuous Glucose Monitoring data analysis in Python
Glyco aims to be an Open Source library to analyze glucose data (from CGMs) in Python.

# To do:
* [ ] if read df returns error tell check if you need to skiprows
* [ ] handle meals
* [ ] add day summaries
* [ ] handle exercise
* [ ] add glycemic variability calculations
* [ ] handle other CGM sources
* [ ] add conversion of glucose units
* [ ] move to utils

# Data samples
* *sample_glucose* : a glucose sample from `Freestyle Libre` data. The data glucose is in `mmol/L`.
* 
*
