# Healthcare Considerations

## Algorithm Description 

### 1. General Information

**Intended Use Statement:** 
Glyco is intended to be used in a non-clinical setting to analyse continuous glucose monitoring data from healthy individuals. Glyco uses statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to extract useful information from glucose data. In addition, Glyco also enables visualising the glucose data to get insights from the continuous glucose monitoring time series.

Glyco is intended to be used on time series of glucose in units sepcified under [units.md](units.md).

Glyco should not be used for analysing data of individuals with diabetes. Glyco is not intended to be used on individuals using insulin. Thus, Glyco should not be used to evaluate a person's risk for developing diabetes, nor to replace a patient's evaluation, nor to make, confirm or reject diagnoses.
