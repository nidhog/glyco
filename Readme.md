# Continuous Glucose Monitoring data analysis in Python
Glyco aims to be an Open Source Python library to analyze glucose data from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM).

There is very little work related to glucose analysis fro healthy individuals. Glyco aims to make analysing healthy individual glucose data easier. 

## Main features
### 1 - Processing and cleaning
### 2 - Plotting and Visual analysis (EDA)
### 3 - Statistical analysis
### 4 - Meal, activities and events analysis
### 5 - Advanced analysis: Ranking meals, predictions


# To do:
* [ ] if read df returns error tell check if you need to skiprows
* [ ] handle meals
* [ ] add day summaries
* [ ] handle exercise
* [ ] add glycemic variability calculations
* [ ] handle other CGM sources
* [ ] add conversion of glucose units
* [ ] move to utils

* *sample_glucose* : a glucose sample from `Freestyle Libre` data. The data glucose is in `mmol/L`.
